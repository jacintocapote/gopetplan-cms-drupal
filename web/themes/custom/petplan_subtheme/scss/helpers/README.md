The helpers/ folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers weâ€™ll use across the project.
Got a function? A mixin? Put it in there. This folder also contains a _variables.scss file
which holds all global variables for the project.

_variables.scss
_mixins.scss
_functions.scss
_placeholders.scss (frequently named _helpers.scss)
